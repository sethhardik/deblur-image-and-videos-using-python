# deblur image and videos using python

implementation of weiner filter using opencv is demonstrated in the file.

weiner filter is scratch coded and for using weiner filter we need to know the type of blur we are dealing with .

it works best for motion blur.

and motion blur can be removed by creating a kernel of original image and passing that kernal in the wiener filter function.
the function returns the filtered image which is deblured image that we wanted .
